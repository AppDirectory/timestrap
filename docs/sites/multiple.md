## Multiple Sites

Timestrap supports setting up multiple sites with configurations options 
available on a per-site basis. This functionality may be useful if, for 
example, there is a need to separate departments or functional teams within a 
larger group of organization.

Sites can be managed by any user with admin access and appropriate permissions:
either `superuser` or the various `site` and `conf` permissions. Sites are 
based on domain and use two primary settings, `domain` and `name` in addition 
to the various configuration options available.

Clients and tasks can be shared between all or some sites, while entries and 
invoices are tied only to the site they are created on.
