## Time and Date Localization

If you wish to change things like the date strings you'll need to play around
with [Django's format localization settings](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/i18n/formatting/#controlling-localization-in-templates)
in `timestrap/settings/base.py`. We don't do anything to try and localize by
default but we are trying to avoid lock-in to a specific format. If you enable
localization and run into any bugs let us know!
